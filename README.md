# Advanced Behaviors:

This module contains behavior trees and advanced behavior related logic for NPCs.
All behavior changes are governed by the Event-driven Behavior System where an UpdateBehaviorEvent that is fired, triggers behavior changes.

This module serves as a supplementary library module for other modules like WildAnimals and GooeysQuests.
It consists of components, systems and behavior nodes packaged together to define behavioral traits that can be attached as attribute to any NPC using the respective component.
